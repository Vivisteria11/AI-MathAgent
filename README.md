## 🚀 Demo

## API Key Handling

For demonstration, the API key is currently hardcoded in `streamlit_app.py` for immediate testing.

In real applications, API keys should be stored securely using environment variables or secret managers.

Due to deployment constraints, .env file did not work reliably for this demo.

Future updates may include:

- Allowing users to enter their own API keys dynamically.
- Using proper secret storage techniques.
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Backend:** Python  
- **LLM API:** Gemini Pro (`Google Generative AI`)  
- **Data Source:** GSM8K (math reasoning dataset)  
- **Utilities:** Pandas, pyngrok
